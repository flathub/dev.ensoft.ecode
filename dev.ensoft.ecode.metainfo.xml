        <p>
            ecode is a lightweight multi-platform code editor designed for modern hardware with a
            focus on responsiveness and performance. It has been developed with the
            hardware-accelerated eepp GUI, which provides the core technology for the editor. The
            project comes as the first serious project using the eepp GUI, and it's currently being
            developed to improve the eepp GUI library as part of one of its main objectives.
